# tf2-web-server-manager
A Team Fortress 2 server manager that runs inside your browser.

To run, start the program and visit "localhost:3000" on your browser. There, you can log in to your server and run any command as if you were on the server window
It is possible to override the port by passing it as the first parameter to the program i.e. "tf2-server-manager 80" to run it on port 80
